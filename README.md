Puzzlelog
========================

This is my repo for coding puzzles I have worked on in the past that can be found around the web. I've done these for a variety of reasons: participating in coding competitions, prepping for technical interviews, practicing my general skills, and simply trying to solve interesting exercises. 

Exercises
--------
- Reverse a LinkedList (iteratively and recursively)
- Write a basic spreadsheet evaluator
- Implement a circular buffer
- Given a list of integers, write a program to output an integer-valued list of equal length such that the output elt at index i is the product of all input elts except for the input elt i
- Given a set of strings, group all anagrams together
- Given list of words, output first and second longest words that can be composed of words in the list
