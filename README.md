Puzzlelog
========================

This is my repo for coding puzzles I have worked on in the past that can be found around the web. I've done these for a variety of reasons: participating in coding competitions, prepping for technical interviews, practicing my general skills, and simply trying to solve interesting exercises. 

Puzzles
--------
- [Reverse a LinkedList](https://github.com/psoshnin/puzzlelog/blob/master/linkedlists/LinkedListProblemClass.java) (iteratively and recursively)
- Write a basic [spreadsheet evaluator](https://github.com/psoshnin/puzzlelog/tree/master/misc/spreadsheet_evaluator)
- Implement a [circular buffer](https://github.com/psoshnin/puzzlelog/blob/master/misc/CircularBuffer.java)
- Given a list of integers, write a [program](https://github.com/psoshnin/puzzlelog/blob/master/misc/ExceptInput.java) to output an integer-valued list of equal length such that the output elt at index i is the product of all input elts except for the input elt i
- Given a set of strings, [group all anagrams together](https://github.com/psoshnin/puzzlelog/blob/master/misc/GroupAnagrams.java)
- Given list of words, output [first and second longest words](https://github.com/psoshnin/puzzlelog/blob/master/misc/LongestWord.java) that can be composed of words in the list
- Write a [boggle solver](https://github.com/psoshnin/puzzlelog/tree/master/misc/boggle_solver)
- Generate the [power set](https://github.com/psoshnin/puzzlelog/blob/master/misc/PowerSet.java)
