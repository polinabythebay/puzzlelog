### Boggle Solver

Given an n by n grid of letters, output a list of all possible words you can make from the grid. Following Boggle conventions, words can be 3 or more sequentially adjacent letters (adjacent letters are horizontal, diagonal, or vertically neighboring). 

Different approaches used:

1. Recursion + Binary Search
2. Modified Recursion + Prefix Tree (Trie)
3. Dynamic Programming (no search space)
